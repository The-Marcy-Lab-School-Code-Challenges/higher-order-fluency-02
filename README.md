# Code Challenge: High-Order Array Methods

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to AWS Cloud9. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Problems 

1. Write a function named `pluralize` that takes an array of words that are singular and returns a new array of the same words pluralized.
    
    ```jsx
    pluralize(animals) // ['cheetahs','dogs', 'cats', 'dodobirds', 'bears', 'dolphins']
    ```

2. Write a function named `oddLength` that  takes an array of strings and returns an array of just the words that have an odd number of characters:
    
    ```jsx
    oddLength(animals) // ['cheetah','dog', 'cat', 'dolphin']
    ```

3. Write a function named `longWords` that takes an array of strings and returns only the strings with more than 3 letters
    
    ```jsx
    longWords(animals) // ['cheetah', 'dodobird', 'bear', 'dolphin']
    ```

4. Write a function named `longerThanSeven` that takes an array of strings and returns true if at least one of the strings in the array has a length longer than 7. 
    
    ```jsx
    longerThanSeven(animals) // true 
    ```
